            <p class="quote-highlight">"Datanow gives us the visibility to make real-time, data driven decisions."</p>
            <p>"As a manager across multiple busy operational sites, my focus is on getting quality, real-time information to the people on the ground. I need solid data, that's transparent to everyone, for effective decisions to be made that will improve productivity, yield, and efficiency. That's where Datanow comes in.</p>
            <p>It's an incredibly effective, insightful, and easy-to-use tool. What's more it didn't take long for everyone to engage because it gave feedback on actions very quickly and simply. Datanow gives us the visibility to make real-time, data-driven decisions, and focus in on specific causes of downtime or production losses – lifting performance and making a measurable improvement across the plants.</p>
            <p>The first system installed made such a positive impact within the first few weeks that we rolled it out across the other sites immediately."</p>
